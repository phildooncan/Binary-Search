# Binary-Search

Practice program I wrote while studing DS and Algos to practice array pointers and a simple algorithm. 
C program: takes input for size of array, populates array with psuedo-random numbers between 1-100, sorts it, then prompt for number to look for
Uses binary search to find number.
